      overview: "With the onset of the global pandemic, many aspects of daily life shifted to an online environment. Education was no exception. Our team asked, how could we increase the productivity and engagement of remote learning solutions to better accommodate the needs and wants of users within the field of education? Inspired by regenerative design, we focused on building out existing systems, rather than building a completely new one from scratch. This way, we could address persistent problems right at the source they were originating. Using Zoom as a backbone, the team proposed a series of changes that would improve levels of participation: avatars, reactions, dynamic bubble size, and more.",

      overview: "As freshmen, students often come in unprepared and unsure of what their four-year plan in college will be. This is perfectly understandable, given the change in environment and new experience that university life brings. However, the need for a four-year plan is crucial, and many students often go through much of their time through college without one, which can potentially lead to problems in the future. The web application, Degreezy, aims to help students optimize their college career by creating a college plan suited for their area of study. It keeps track of course requirements and prerequisites, enabling students to keep complete track of their degree progress.",

      overview: "Within my program's collaborative design-centric studio space, a common everyday \"annoyance\" is the lack of backpack storage. As a result, these bags would often be placed on the ground where they would be out of reach and would also encumber efforts to rearrange tables and chairs. My goal was to find an accommodative solution that wouldn't require extensive installation. Often times, the most apt solution is the simplest one: a table hook that would promote feelings of stability and security (deemed important because of the heavy and valuable contents of most backpacks).",

      overview: "Within my shared university living accommodations, the bathroom doorknob had no lock! To increase privacy, I wanted to find a non-invasive way to signal the bathroom was in use. A magnetic mechanism, with two magnet circles (stickered half-green and half-red) and two plastic housings, provided the ideal non-invasive and impermanent solution. When applied on both sides of the bathroom door, societally understood paradigms would allow for easy use (rotate to green for open/free, and red for closed/busy).",
