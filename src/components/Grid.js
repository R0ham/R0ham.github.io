          <h1>Hello! My name is Roham.</h1>
          <p>I am a creative thinker, with strong visual and technical skills. In my free time, I like to learn and experience new activities! I recently wrote a short story, enjoyed paddle boarding for the first time, and continue to be an avid biker. I love well-told stories and will consume them in all forms. I like challenging myself to continuously grow and will frequently self-reflect to do so. Iâ€™m also passionate and driven, and will proactively find opportunity areas I want to participate in. I thrive most in freeform environments with close-knit teams.</p>
