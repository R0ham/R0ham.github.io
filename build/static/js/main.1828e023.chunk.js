Education was no exception. Our team asked, how could we increase the productivity and engagement of remote learning solutions to better accommodate the needs and wants of users within the field of education? Inspired by regenerative design, we focused on building out existing systems, rather than building a completely new one from scratch. This way, we could address persistent problems right at the source they were originating. Using Zoom as a backbone, the team proposed a series of changes that would improve levels of participation: avatars, reactions, dynamic bubble size, and more."},{id:2,link:"/degreezy",image:i.p+"static/media/degreezy_cover.972f79aa.png",title:"Degreezy",tagline:"a friendly degree planner",context:"School",org:"6-person team",timeframe:"Semester",role:["Designer","Front-end developer","Integration"],overview:"As freshmen, students often come in unprepared and unsure of what their four-year plan in college will be. This is perfectly understandable, given the change in environment and new experience that university life brings. However, the need for a four-year plan is crucial, and many students often go through much of their time through college without one, which can potentially lead to problems in the future. The web application, Degreezy, aims to help students optimize their college career by creating a college plan suited for their area of study. It keeps track of course requirements and prerequisites, enabling students to keep complete track of their degree progress."},{id:3,link:"/nookhook",image:i.p+"static/media/nook_cover.ab1050ee.jpg",title:"Nook Hook",tagline:"combatting everyday annoyances",context:"School",org:"Solo",timeframe:"1 month",role:["Varied"],overview:"Within my program's collaborative design-centric studio space, a common everyday 'annoyance' is the lack of backpack storage.

Often times, the most apt solution is the simplest one: a table hook that would promote feelings of stability and security (deemed important because of the heavy and valuable contents of most backpacks)."},{id:4,link:"/pushpin",image:i.p+"static/media/pushpin_cover.a0ae8bc5.png",title:"PushPin",tagline:"digital poster bulletin board",context:"School",org:"5-person team",timeframe:"Semester",role:["Designer","Front-end developer"],overview:"Clubs and organizations frequently advertise events and activities through outdated and inefficient paper postering techniques along heavily frequented campus walkways. pushPin is a web-based solution designed to address these issues by bundling event details and club advertisements in one consolidated digital environment.

To increase privacy, I wanted to find a non-invasive way to signal the bathroom was in use. A magnetic mechanism, with two magnet circles (stickered half-green and half-red) and two plastic housings, provided the ideal non-invasive and impermanent solution. When applied on both sides of the bathroom door, societally understood paradigms would allow for easy use (rotate to green for open/free, and red for closed/busy).",prompt:"For this school assignment, our goal was to 'design for yourself.' We did this incrementally, through daily journal entries marking our observations of the world around us. We asked ourselves questions like: What's new? What's the same? What's frustrating? What's comforting? What's working and what isn't? After a few journal entries like this, we were asked to draw our least favorite things/places.",focus:"I ended up drawing many different potential areas of interest, including my uncomfortable dorm room chair and an awkward bench design. But then, I stumbled on a far more critical and interesting issue: the lack of a lock-able doorknob within a shared bathroom space.",process:"I started off with a simple sketch and a brainstorm. I tried thinking about why we expect there to be a lock in the first place, as well shape, color, and utility. It was at this point that I realized I would need a non-invasive, impermanent solution. Why? Well, because this living space was provided by the university under the assumption that it was kept in the same condition.",outcome:"Four pieces are included: two magnetic circles (stickered green and red) and two plastic housings. The plastic housings would be affixed on sides 1 and 2 of the door (inside and outside of the bathroom, respectively) with easily removable adhesive. The small cutout on side 2 would indicate whether the bathroom is free (green) or busy (red). Likewise, the indicator on side 1 would do the same. The intention is that a user would rotate to the color of their using from the inside of the bathroom, which would simultaneously rotate both magnets.",reflection:"I think this project is successful because it relies on paradigms we are already familiar with. Similar interactions and colors are used in public stalls and combination locks.
